## Task: Create a Subnet in Azure Virtual Network
The Nautilus DevOps team is strategizing the migration of a portion of their infrastructure to the Azure cloud. Recognizing the scale of this undertaking, they have opted to approach the migration in incremental steps rather than as a single massive transition.

For this task, create a Virtual Network (VNet) named `datacenter-vnet` and one subnet named `datacenter-subnet` within the VNet in the `East US` region. Make sure the `IPv4 address range` is `10.0.0.0/16`.
