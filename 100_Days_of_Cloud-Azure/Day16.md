## Task: Create a Private Azure Blob Storage Container
As part of the data migration process, the Nautilus DevOps team is actively creating several storage containers on Azure. They plan to utilize private Blob containers to store the relevant data. Given the ongoing migration of other infrastructure to Azure, it is logical to consolidate data storage within the Azure environment as well.

Create a new storage account named `nautilusst21673` and a `private` Blob container named `nautilus-blob-26100` within the storage account.

#### **Step 8: Create a New Container**
Click **Add container** at the top of the page. In the **New container** panel, provide the following values:

![container settings](assets/day16_05.png)

The container will be created immediately.

**Public Access Level Options:**
- **Private (no anonymous access):** No public read access (most secure)
- **Blob (anonymous read access for blobs only):** Blobs can be read anonymously
- **Container (anonymous read access for containers and blobs):** Full anonymous read access

#### **Step 9: Verify Container Creation**
Once the container is created:

- You should see **nautilus-blob-26100** listed in the containers view  
- Click on the container name to view its details  
- Verify the **Public access level** is set to **Private**
