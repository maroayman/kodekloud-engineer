## Task
The Nautilus DevOps team is strategizing the migration of a portion of their infrastructure to the Azure cloud. Recognizing the scale of this undertaking, they have opted to approach the migration in incremental steps rather than as a single massive transition. To achieve this, they have segmented large tasks into smaller, more manageable units. This granular approach enables the team to execute the migration in gradual phases, ensuring smoother implementation and minimizing disruption to ongoing operations.

Create a Virtual Network (VNet) named `devops-vnet` in the `East US` region with any `IPv4` CIDR block.

#### **Step 5: Configure IP Address Space**
In the **IP Addresses** tab:

- **IPv4 address space:** Use the default CIDR block (e.g., `10.0.0.0/16`) or specify your own IPv4 CIDR block  
- **Subnet:** A default subnet will be created automatically (e.g., `default` with `10.0.0.0/24`)
